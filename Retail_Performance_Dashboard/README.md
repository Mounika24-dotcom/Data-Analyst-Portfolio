# 📊 Retail Performance Dashboard (Tableau)

## 📌 1. Project Overview  
Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Superstore dataset to analyze **sales performance**, **profitability**, **discount impact**, and **shipping mode efficiency** across U.S. regions and product categories.  

The goal of this dashboard is to transform raw retail transactions into **actionable business insights** that support decisions in pricing, discounting, inventory planning, and strategy.

---

## ❓ 2. Business Questions Answered  
- Which regions generate the **highest and lowest** sales and profit?  
- How do different **product categories** contribute to revenue and profitability?  
- Do **higher discounts** reduce profit? If yes, by how much?  
- Which **shipping modes** are most and least profitable?  
- How does **monthly profit** vary across different regions?  

---

## 🧠 3. Key Insights  
- The **West region** leads in overall sales, while **Central** has weaker profit margins.  
- **Furniture category** shows strong sales but low/negative profit due to high discounting.  
- A strong **negative correlation** exists between **Discount** and **Profit**  
  → excessive discounting directly reduces profitability.  
- **Standard Class** shipping yields the highest overall profit; **Same Day** shipping performs worst.  
- Monthly profit trends show clear **seasonality** and region-specific performance swings.

📊 Retail Performance Dashboard (Tableau)
📌 1. Project Overview
Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Superstore dataset to analyze sales performance, profitability, discount impact, and shipping mode efficiency across U.S. regions and product categories.
The goal of this dashboard is to transform raw retail transactions into actionable business insights that support decisions in pricing, discounting, inventory planning, and strategy.
❓ 2. Business Questions Answered
Which regions generate the highest and lowest sales and profit?
How do different product categories contribute to revenue and profitability?
Do higher discounts reduce profit? If yes, by how much?
Which shipping modes are most and least profitable?
How does monthly profit vary across different regions?
🧠 3. Key Insights
The West region leads in overall sales, while Central has weaker profit margins.
Furniture shows strong sales but low/negative profit due to heavy discounting.
A strong negative correlation exists between Discount and Profit → excessive discounting reduces profitability.
Standard Class shipping yields the highest profit; Same Day shipping performs worst.
Monthly profit trends show clear seasonality and region-specific shifts.

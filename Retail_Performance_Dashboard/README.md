# 📊 Retail Performance Dashboard (Tableau)

## 📌 1. Project Overview  
Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Superstore dataset to analyze **sales performance**, **profitability**, **discount impact**, and **shipping mode efficiency** across U.S. regions and product categories.

The goal of this dashboard is to transform raw retail transactions into **actionable business insights** that support decisions in pricing, discounting, inventory planning, and strategic management.

---

## ❓ 2. Business Questions Answered  
- Which regions generate the **highest and lowest** sales and profit?  
- How do different product categories contribute to **revenue and profitability**?  
- Do **higher discounts** reduce profit? If yes, by how much?  
- Which **shipping modes** are the most and least profitable?  
- How does **monthly profit** vary across different regions?  

---

## 🧠 3. Key Insights  
- The **West** region leads in overall sales, while the **Central** region has weaker profit margins.  
- **Furniture** shows strong sales but low or negative profit due to heavy discounting.  
- A strong **negative correlation** exists between **Discount** and **Profit**, confirming that excessive discounting erodes profitability.  
- **Standard Class** shipping delivers the highest profit; **Same Day** shipping performs the worst.  
- Monthly profit patterns reveal **seasonality** and region-specific shifts.
